- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pablo Nogueira, and I hail from my beautiful homeland, Mexico. I'm Currently doing my Ph.D. In Biomedical Sciences at the School Of Medicine, UNAM and the Center for the Sciences of Complexity under the guidance of Dr. Markus MÃ¼ller. 
My research topic is the neuroscience of social interaction and I use the hyperscanning and complex systems approaches to delve in the mechanisms that allow to participate in Cooperative and competitive interactions.

You can reach me at pablo.nogueira@c3.unam.mx
